<h1>Specifications</h1>

<h2>CHIP-8 has the following components:</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Memory: CHIP-8 has direct access to up to 4 kilobytes of RAM.</li><br>
    <li>Display: 64 x 32 pixels (or 128 x 64 for SUPER-CHIP)<br> monochrome, ie. black or white</li><br>
    <li>A program counter, often called just “PC”, which points at<br> the current instruction in memory</li><br>
    <li>One 16-bit index register called “I” which is used to<br> point at locations in memory</li><br>
    <li>A stack for 16-bit addresses, which is used to call<br> subroutines/functions and return from them</li><br>
    <li>An 8-bit delay timer which is decremented at a<br> rate of 60 Hz (60 times per second) until it reaches 0</li><br>
    <li>An 8-bit sound timer which functions like the delay timer,<br> but which also gives off a beeping sound as long as it’s not 0</li><br>
    <li>16 8-bit (one byte) general-purpose variable registers numbered 0<br> through F hexadecimal, ie. 0 through 15 in decimal, called V0 through `VF</li><br>
    <li>VF is also used as a flag register; many instructions will set it to<br> either 1 or 0 based on some rule, for example using it as a carry flag</li><br>

  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>The memory should be 4 kB (4 kilobytes, ie. 4096 bytes) large.<br>
   CHIP-8’s index register and program counter can only address 12 bits (conveniently), which is 4096 addresses.<br><br>
 <em>Both the index register, program counter and stack entries are actually 16 bits long.<br>
    In theory, they could increment beyond 4 kB of memory addresses.<br>
     In practice, no CHIP-8 games do that. The early computers running CHIP-8 usually had less than 4 kB of RAM anyway.</em><br><br>
     All the memory is RAM and should be considered to be writable.<br>
      CHIP-8 games can, and do, modify themselves.<br><br>
    <em>CHIP-8 programs you find online as binary files are often called “ROMs”,<br> like game files for video game emulators, but unlike games on console cartridges<br> they were not actually ROM (which means “read-only memory”).</em><br><br>
    The first CHIP-8 interpreter (on the COSMAC VIP computer) was also located in RAM,<br>
     from address 000 to 1FF. It would expect a CHIP-8 program to be loaded into memory after it,
     <br> starting at address 200 (512 in decimal).<br>
      Although modern interpreters are not in the same memory space, you should do the same to be able to run the old programs;<br>
       you can just leave the initial space empty, except for the font.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
 <p>The CHIP-8 emulator should have a built-in font,<br> with sprite data representing the hexadecimal numbers from 0 through F.<br>
    Each font character should be 4 pixels wide by 5 pixels tall.<br>
    These font sprites are drawn just like regular sprites (see below).<br><br>
    You should store the font data in memory, because games will draw these characters like regular sprites:<br>
     They set the index register I to the character’s memory location and then draw it.<br>
      There’s a special instruction for setting I to a character’s address, so you can choose where to put it.<br>
       Anywhere in the first 512 bytes (000–1FF) is fine. For some reason,<br>
        it’s become popular to put it at 050–09F, so you can follow that convention if you want.<br><br>
        The font most people use is represented in bytes like this:<br><br>
        <p style='color: white'>
        <span style="background-color: #808080">
        0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, // 0<br><br>
0x20, 0x60, 0x20, 0x20, 0x70, // 1<br><br>
0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, // 2<br><br>
0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 3<br><br>
0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x10, 0x10, // 4<br><br>
0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 5<br><br>
0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, // 6<br><br>
0xF0, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x40, // 7<br><br>
0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, // 8<br><br>
0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x10, 0xF0, // 9<br><br>
0xF0, 0x90, 0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, // A<br><br>
0xE0, 0x90, 0xE0, 0x90, 0xE0, // B<br><br>
0xF0, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0xF0, // C<br><br>
0xE0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xE0, // D<br><br>
0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, // E<br><br>
0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x80, 0x80  // F<br><br><br>

  The original implementation of the Chip-8 language used a 64x32-pixel monochrome display with this format:<br><br>
